Do I check in here for Air Canada to Mexico?
You already have your ticket?
Yes. Here you are.
Thank you. Can you put your luggage up here, please?
Sure, I have three suitcases.
We allow only two pieces. You'll have to pay an extra charge.
Oh! Can I carry this one with me?
No, I'm sorry. It won't fit under your seat.
That's $45.
Here you are.
Thank you. You can choose your seat.
A window seat or aisle seat?
I'd like a window seat, please.
Fine. Seat 15A.
Here's your ticket and your boarding pass.
Enjoy your flight!
