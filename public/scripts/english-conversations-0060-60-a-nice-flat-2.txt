Well, here's the kitchen.
Hmm... It's very small.
Yes, it isn't very large, but there's a cooker and a fridge.
There are some cupboards under the sink.
Are there any plates?
Yes, there are.
Good. Are there any chairs in here?
No, there aren't, but there are some in the living room.
Hmm. There aren't any glasses!
Yes, there are! They're in the cupboard.
and... er... where's the toilet?
