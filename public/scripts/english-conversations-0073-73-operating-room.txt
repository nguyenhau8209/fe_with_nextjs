Mrs, Martin? I'm Dr. Thomas.
Oh, doctor, how is he?
Well, I'm afraid we'll have to operate.
Oh, no! He's always been afraid of operations.
Don't worry. If we operate now, he'll be all right.
Oh, doctor, do you really have to?
I'm afraid so. He's lost a lot of blood.
If we don't operate, he'll die!
Oh, please do whatever you have to.
