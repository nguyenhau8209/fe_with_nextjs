I want to go to the bank this afternoon.
I'll drive you there.
Thanks. I'm going to apply for a loan.
Why do you need a loan?
I have to buy a new car.
What's wrong with your car?
It won't start, and it's ten years old.
How much will a new car cost?
About $15,000.
Wow! That's a lot of money.
I know. That's why I need a loan.
