Is it cold out?
Yes, it's cold and windy!
I'm going to wear my heavy coat.
Good idea! Where are you going?
To the post office.
Why?
To mail this package.
Would you buy some stamps for me?
Sure. How many do you want?
Ten.
Here's the money for the stamps.
Okay. I'll be back in twenty minutes, unless I get blown away!
