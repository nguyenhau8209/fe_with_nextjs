Hey! What's the matter with the phone?
Here, listen to this peculiar noise.
It doesn't sound like a dial tone.
It must be out of order.
We'd better notify the phone company.
How do we do that? We can't use the phone.
Let's go next door and use our neighbour's phone.
He's always complaining about people. I don't wanna ask any favours of him.
How about across the street?
I forgot about Mrs. Riley! I'm sure she'd let us use her phone.
