Do you like snow?
No! I hate it!
Why? Snow is so pretty.
Yes, but I don't like to drive in it.
Well, it's beginning to snow.
And I have to drive to work.
How far is it to work?
Six miles. Are we going to get much snow?
About twelve inches, they say.
Oh no! Driving will be dangerous!
Please be careful!
I will, by the way, can I borrow your car?
