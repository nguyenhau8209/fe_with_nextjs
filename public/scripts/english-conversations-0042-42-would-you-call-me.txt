Well, see you tomorrow.
I'd better go, too.
Oh, would you do me a favour?
Sure.
Would you call me tomorrow at six o'clock in the morning?
Tomorrow's my daughter's birthday. I wanna get her a new robe,
and I have to pick up the dry cleaning, and pick up the cake from the bakery.
Anyway, I have lots of things to do.
But I'm not sure I can get up early.
Do you need a hand?
Oh, can you? That would be great.
Can you go to the mall and buy her a new robe,
pick up the dry cleaning, and get the cake from the bakery?
And what will you be doing?
Sleeping in of course!
