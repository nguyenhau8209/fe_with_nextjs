Where are you going?
To Canada.
Why are you going there?
I'm going to learn English;
there's a school there that has an excellent program.
Is learning English going to be difficult?
Yes. I have to study and practice a lot.
Where's your school?
It's in a town called St. Catharines in Ontario.
I'm jealous, I'll bet you're excited.
Yes, but I'm also really nervous.
