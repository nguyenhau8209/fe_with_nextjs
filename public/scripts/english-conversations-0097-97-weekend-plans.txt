It's been raining all week.
Any plans for the weekend?
I was hoping to go hiking,
but it doesn't look promising with this weather.
How about you?
I had plans to visit the beach, but I might have to cancel, too.
Have you checked the forecast?
Any chance it'll clear up?
Not really.
Looks like we might need to find some indoor activities instead.
Maybe we could just watch some movies or read a book.
