Hey! Hey!
What's wrong?
There's something wrong with the phone. I'm getting a strange noise.
Are you? I can hear you clearly.
Hello! Hello!
This pay phone might be out of order.
I'll call you again with another phone....
Hello! How about now? Is there still a strange noise?
Yes. Perhaps my phone is out of order.
You should get in touch with the phone company.
