Jean!
Barbara! Do you work around here?
Yes, I work in that building across the street.
Really? What do you do?
I work in a law office, I'm a secretary.
Oh, that's interesting.
What about you? What do you do?
I work at Duru Restaurant.
Oh... are you a cook?
No, I'm a waitress.
That's a really hard job; I don't envy you.
Me neither!
Do you live alone, Jean?
No, I don't. I live with my family. How about you?
I'm married now. I got married last year.
Really? Congratulations! Who did you marry?
His name's Jeff Hunt. He lives in my building.
Oh, what does he do?
He's a doctor.
How wonderful, I'm very happy for you!
