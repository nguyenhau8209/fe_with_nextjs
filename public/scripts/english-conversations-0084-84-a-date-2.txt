Hello?
Sandy? Is that you?
Yes, uh-huh. Who's this?
It's Gill.
Gill? Gill who?
What do you mean, "Gill who?" Gill Dixon, of course.
Oh, Gill, I'm sorry.
Yes. We had a date last night.
Where were you? I waited for one hour.
Oh, I'm sorry, Gill. I couldn't come.
Couldn't come! Why not?
Well, I had to pack my stuff for my trip.
Why didn't you call me?
I wanted to call you, but... uh... I couldn't remember your phone number.
And now I'm going to forget yours!
