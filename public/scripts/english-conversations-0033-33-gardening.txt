Your garden is really lovely.
Thank you. I enjoy working in the garden.
Do you do everything yourself?
I trim the bushes and weed the flowerbeds myself.
Who cuts the grass?
Oh, it's so big that I hire one of the boys in the neighbourhood to do it for me.
Well, I must say he does a good job.
Yes. His work is more than satisfactory.
