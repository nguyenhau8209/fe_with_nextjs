Did you visit Redwood National Park over the weekend?
Yes. It was incredible!
The trees are so tall and majestic.
Oh, I bet!
Did you take the guided tour or explore on your own?
We decided to explore on our own.
The map we got at the visitor center was really helpful.
Were there many people there?
Not too many.
We went early in the morning, so it was pretty peaceful.
