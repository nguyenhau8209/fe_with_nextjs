Hello, Jack. This is Dave.
I want to return the book I borrowed from you last night.
Will you be home at about six o'clock?
Yes, I will. I'll be cooking dinner.
Oh! Well. Then I won't come over at six.
Why not?
I don't want to disturb you.
Don't worry! You won't disturb me.
OK. I'll see you at six.
