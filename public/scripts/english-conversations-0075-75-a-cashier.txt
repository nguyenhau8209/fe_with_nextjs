What kind of work do you do?
I'm a cashier at a supermarket.
Do you like your job?
No, It's not very interesting.
And you don't make much money.
That's right. I make very little.
I think you should look for another job.
I am, but it's not easy to find one.
Keep looking! You'll get one.
Thanks. I hope you're right.
