Do you smoke? I've never known that.
When did you start smoking?
I started smoking when I was eighteen.
So, how long have you been a smoker?
I've smoked for twenty years.
How many cigarettes do you smoke a day?
I smoke two packs of cigarettes a day.
Have you ever tried to quit?
Yes, I have quit twice: once when I was expecting my baby, Paul,
and the other time when I had a bad sore throat.
But I had a hard time.
If you knew what it was doing to your lungs,
you would think twice about it!
