How are you settling in?
Oh, we're still in a bit of a mess, but Lisa seems to like it here.
That's good. Is there a garden for her to play in?
Yes, it's not very big, but we've got a small swimming pool.
Have you found a school for Jerry?
Yes, there's one near here. It only takes 5 minutes by car.
That's good. So you like it there, do you, Neal?
Yes, this is a very good place for my children.
