Good morning. Perhaps you can advise me...
Yes, ma'am.
I'm looking for a toy for my niece.
Oh, yes... how old is she?
She'll be seven years old on Sunday.
Skateboards are still very popular.
Hmm, I don't want her to hurt herself.
What about a Barbie Doll set?
I don't think so. She has many Barbie Dolls.
Have you got anything educational?
You see, she's a very intelligent girl.
I've got the perfect thing!
A do-it-yourself kit where you can build your own Barbie Doll who rides a skateboard!
