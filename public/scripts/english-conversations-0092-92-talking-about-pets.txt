Do you have any pets at home?
Yes, I have a dog and a cat.
They're both really friendly.
That sounds nice! What are their names?
The dog's name is Max, and the cat's name is Whiskers.
Do you have any pets?
Not right now, but I used to have a turtle named Tiny.
He was really cute.
Turtles are great!
They don't need too much attention but are still fun to watch.
