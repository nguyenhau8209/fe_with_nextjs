Do you know what's on the menu at the cafeteria today?
They have grilled chicken,
a vegetarian pasta,
and a soup of the day.
Do you know if they have any gluten-free options?
I'm trying to avoid gluten.
Let me check...
Okay, the grilled chicken is gluten-free.
They also have a quinoa salad that should be safe.
Great, thanks!
Do you have any idea what the soup of the day is?
I think it's mushroom soup,
but you might want to ask them to be sure.
