Oh, Miss Wallace! Long time no see.
How are you?
Good. Thank you. How's your new job?
I started working today.
How does it seem so far?
It's demanding, but I'm happy to be working.
What's your boss like?
He appears to be very thoughtful and kind,
but they all do at first.
I guess we will have to wait and see.
Well, I wish you the best of luck.
Thanks, take care.
