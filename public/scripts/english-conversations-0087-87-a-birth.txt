Have you heard about the good news in the Wallace family?
No, I've been out of town.
Mrs Wallace went into the hospital last night and gave birth to a baby girl seven hours later.
That's very good. But they already have a little girl, don't they?
No, they have a 5-year-old boy.
So they wanted a girl this time, right?
Yes, they wanted a girl for a long time.
Was it natural childbirth?
No, she had to have a caesarean.
