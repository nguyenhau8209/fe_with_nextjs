Good morning. Can I see your passport?
Certainly. Here it is.
Yes, that's all right. Have you got anything to declare?
Yes, I have. I've got some whisky and some cigarettes.
How much whisky have you got?
A litre.
That's all right. And how many cigarettes have you got?
200.
Fine. What about perfume?
Er... No, I haven't.
Good. Open your case, please.
Pardon?
Open your case, please. Open it now!
Oh, dear! Look at this!
You've got 3 bottles of whisky, 400 cigarettes and a lot of perfume!
Does that mean I can't go?
