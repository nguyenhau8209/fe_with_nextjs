Diana!
Oh, George... hi, how are you?
Listen, I'm in a terrible hurry.
The bank closes in twenty minutes.
Is your bank near here?
Yes, it's only four blocks away, on Vine Street.
Well, get in. I'll take you.
Are you sure? It's not out of your way?
No, not at all.
That is so nice of you, George. Thank you.
You're welcome.
