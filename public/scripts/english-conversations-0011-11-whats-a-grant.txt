My daughter is going to college.
That's great, but it must be expensive.
Yes, but she has a grant.
A grant? What's a grant?
The government is giving her money.
To pay for her education?
That's right.
Does it pay for everything?
No, she has a loan, too.
What's the difference between a loan and a grant?
You have to pay back a loan; a grant is a gift.
