Do you like my new coat?
It looks terrific!
I'm glad you like it.
How much was it?
$80.
That's a good price.
Yeah, it was on sale.
Where did you get it?
At Sears.
I like to shop there, too;
they always have really good sales!
Maybe you should go there today,
they have a sale on shirts if you're interested.
Good idea! I need some.
