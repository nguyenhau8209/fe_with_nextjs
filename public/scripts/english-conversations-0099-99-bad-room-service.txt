Did you notice that our room wasn't cleaned today?
Yes, I did.
I was quite surprised when I got back and saw the mess still there.
Do you think we should call the front desk or go down there ourselves?
Let's call them first and see what they say.
Maybe they just missed our room by mistake.
Okay. I hope they can send someone up soon;
it's really not comfortable like this.
Yeah, and let's also remind them about the extra pillows we asked for this morning.
