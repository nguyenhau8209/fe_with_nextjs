Now let's see... Vine Street is that way...
Yes, just turn left at this corner.
To Bridge Street?
Is that street Bridge Street?
Yes. There is a sign. Can you see that?
Oh, you're right. Well, I have to go to Jay Street.
I think the next one is Jay Street.
Oh, right. Let's turn left at the next corner.
Diana! This street is College Street, not Jay Street.
Oh... uh, go straight ahead one more block!
Are you sure? It's already 4:20!
I should have taken a cab!
That's gratitude for you!
