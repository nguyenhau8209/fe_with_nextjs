Well, hello, Mr Wallace.
You seem unusually happy today.
I just became a father!
Congratulations. A boy or a girl?
You never saw such a cute girl.
Nine pounds, three ounces... and as cute as a button.
Doesn't this call for cigars?
Oh, yes. I forgot about the cigars. Here, have one.
Thank you. How's your wife?
She's just fine.
