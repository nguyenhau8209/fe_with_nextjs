Did you see my car keys?
They're on top of the TV.
You're right. Thanks!
Where are you going?
To the supermarket.
Again?
Yes, we eat a lot.
Do you want me to go with you?
Sure, if you can.
Good. The packages will be heavy.
There's a new health store right up the road;
maybe since you guys eat a lot you should try and eat more healthily.
Maybe you're right;
we have all put on a little weight.
