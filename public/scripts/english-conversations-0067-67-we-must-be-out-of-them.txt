Hi! Sorry I'm late. I missed the bus.
Oh, that's OK. I had time to clean up before you came.
You don't look very good.
I must be getting a cold. I've been sneezing all day.
A-A-ATCHOO!
Bless you.
Thank you.
You must be getting a cold.
Why don't you go lie down? I'll bring you some aspirin.
I don't see any aspirin in the medicine cabinet.
We must be out of them.
I'll go to the drugstore. Is there anything else we need?
Could you get some... ATCHOO...
I don't know if they sell ATCHOO here, but I'll check!
