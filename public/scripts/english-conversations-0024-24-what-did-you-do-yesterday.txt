Hi, how are you?
You look tired.
Did you sleep okay last night?
No, I didn't.
Why? What did you do yesterday?
I went to a nightclub last night and danced all night.
Oh, yeah? Did you have a good time?
I had a wonderful time, but I'm beat today.
What time did you leave the nightclub?
I left at about 3:00 a.m.
I'm not surprised that you're tired.
Which nightclub did you go to?
Fantastic. It's on Ontario Street. It's really nice.
