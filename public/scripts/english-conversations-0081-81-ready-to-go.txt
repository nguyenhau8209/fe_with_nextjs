Are you ready?
Grace is still in her room.
She needs to rush. We don't have enough time.
What time does the movie begin?
It starts at 7:30.
What's the time now?
About 7:10.
There's no hurry. It only takes ten minutes by car to get there.
I know, but there aren't enough parking spaces around the theatre.
Well, I'd better tell Grace to hurry up.
She can take hours to get ready.
