Are you planning to take the photography class next semester?
Yes, I heard Professor Adams is really good at teaching the basics.
Have you taken his class before?
Actually, I did last spring.
He really focuses on practical skills.
That sounds excellent.
Do we need any specific equipment for his class?
A DSLR camera is highly recommended,
but you can also use a mirrorless camera.
Thank you, Lisa.
I'll make sure to get my gear ready.
No problem, James.
It's going to be a fun class!
