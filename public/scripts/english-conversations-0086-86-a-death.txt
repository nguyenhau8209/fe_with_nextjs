Did you hear about the Smith family?
No, what happened?
Mrs. Smith passed away this morning.
That's a shame. What from?
Heart attack, I think.
That's a terrible thing.
Yes. Mrs Smith went into hospital last night by ambulance and died this morning.
Had she been suffering from heart disease?
Yeah. Mrs Smith had it for five years before she died.
Did they try surgery?
She had two operations, but they weren't effective.
I feel sorry for Mr. Smith.
