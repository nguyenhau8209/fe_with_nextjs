I'm trying to find a wedding anniversary present for my wife.
Yes, sir. What exactly are you looking for?
I'm not sure, really. Perhaps you can help me.
Right... I'll show you some pendants.
No, I bought a pendant for her birthday.
Maybe a necklace, then.
These necklaces are made of gold.
Yes... I like this one. What's the stone?
It's a ruby, sir... and it's only $1200!
Ah... well, perhaps you could show me some bracelets, then.
