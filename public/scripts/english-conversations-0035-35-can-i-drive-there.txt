What time is it?
It's three o'clock.
Oh no, I'm late.
Where are you going?
To the dentist.
Can I drive you there?
Sure! That will help.
Do you have a toothache?
Yes, and it's very bad.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I've had it for weeks, and this is the first time that I could get in.
My dentist is always so busy!
I guess that's a good thing! It means a lot of people like him.
