Can I get you something to drink?
A cup of coffee, please.
With milk and sugar?
A little milk, but no sugar.
I never drink coffee at night.
Why not?
It keeps me awake.
What do you drink with supper?
Tea, it helps me relax.
I don't like tea.
There are so many kinds of tea;
maybe you should shop around and try to find one you like
because coffee is bad for you.
That's a good idea.
