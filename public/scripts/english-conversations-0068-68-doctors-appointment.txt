When can I see Dr. Know?
He won't be free until tomorrow.
Can I make an appointment?
Sure. How about tomorrow at ten o'clock?
Can you make it at nine?
I'll check to see if he's available.
I'm sorry but he's tied up until ten o'clock.
Well, can't you squeeze me in, somehow?
I'm afraid not.
How about after lunch?
Will one o'clock be all right?
That's perfect. Thank you.
