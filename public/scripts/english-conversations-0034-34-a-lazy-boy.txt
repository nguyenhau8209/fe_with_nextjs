I'm very angry with my son, Harry.
Why? What's the problem?
He's not doing well in school.
That's a surprise. Harry's a smart boy.
Yes, but he never studies.
Did you talk to his teachers?
Yes, I did.
What did they say?
He's a nice boy, but he's very lazy.
Maybe they're right.
I'm afraid so.
Have you thought about getting him a tutor?
Maybe that's a good idea; I really want him to excel.
Let's go look in the phone book now then.
