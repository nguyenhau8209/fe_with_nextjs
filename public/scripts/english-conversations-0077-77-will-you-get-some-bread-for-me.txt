Is there a bakery near here?
Yes, you can get there in five minutes.
That's good. I don't have much time.
Why are you going to the bakery?
To buy a birthday cake.
Whose birthday is it?
My daughter's. She's ten.
That's nice. Will you get some bread for me?
Sure, do you want anything else?
No, thanks. I'll pay you when you get back.
