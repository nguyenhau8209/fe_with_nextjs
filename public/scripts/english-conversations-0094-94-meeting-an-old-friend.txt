I can't believe it's been almost five years since we last saw each other.
Yeah, it's crazy how time flies.
How have you been?
I've been good! I just moved to a new city for work.
What about you?
I've been busy with my job too, but I'm still in the same place.
Are you liking your new city?
Yes, it's great!
There's so much to explore.
I just miss some old friends.
We should catch up more often and not let so much time pass.
