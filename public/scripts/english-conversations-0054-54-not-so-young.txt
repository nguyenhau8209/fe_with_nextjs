My son is graduating from high school today!
And my daughter is graduating next year.
How old is she?
She's sixteen.
I remember when she was a baby.
I know. We're getting old.
Don't say that!
Why not? It's true.
No, it isn't. We were young when we got married.
That's right, but we got married 25 years ago!
