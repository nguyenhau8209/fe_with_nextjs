Good morning, Scott and Smith Law Office. May I help you?
Yes. May I speak to David Waller, please?
I'm sorry, he isn't here yet. May I take a message?
Yes. Could you ask him to call Marjorie Vale?
How do you spell your last name?
V-A-L-E.
What's your phone number? Does Mr. Waller have it?
Uh, no, he doesn't.
It's 680-5290.
I'm sorry, could you repeat that?
680-5290.
I'll give him the message.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
