Are you free Friday night?
I might not be in town. I'm not sure yet.
A friend suggested I go to Vancouver.
Well, a few of us are getting together, and I thought you might wanna come, too.
What are you thinking of doing?
We're not sure yet.
We might go to a bar, but we'll probably go to see A.I.
Oh, I haven't seen it yet.
Well, come then.
Sure, if I'm in town. I'll call you and let you know.
