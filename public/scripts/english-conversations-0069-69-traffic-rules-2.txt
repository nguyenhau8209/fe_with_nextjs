Excuse me. May I see your licence?
I'm afraid I've left it at home.
In that case, you'll have to take it to the police station within five days.
But why?
You were speeding, ma'am.
But I was only doing 75!
There's a 70km/h speed limit on this road, ma'am.
Is there? I didn't see a sign...
Well, ma'am. We've been following you.
So you were doing 75, too.
No, ma'am. We were doing 90km/h... and we couldn't catch you!
