What are you getting Jim for his birthday?
I don't know yet.
You can always get him a shirt.
But I got him one last year.
Oh, that's right. Let me think.
I want to get him something different.
How about a briefcase?
Good idea! His briefcase is getting old.
And it's something he'll use every day.
Of course! Why didn't I think of that?
