This is a nice flat.
Mmm...
There's a living room. There's a kitchen, a bedroom,
and a bathroom and there's a bidet!
What's a bidet?
It's like a toilet, only better,
I'll let you figure it out!
Well, none of my friends have a bidet, and even if I don't know what it is,
they will be very jealous when I tell them!
