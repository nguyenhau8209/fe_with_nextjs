Teresa! What a surprise! What are you doing here?
Timothy! I don't believe it!
I'm going to see my daughter. She will marry this weekend. How about you?
I'm going to visit my parents.
When is your daughter's wedding?
Sunday.
Wow! This Sunday is the 45th wedding anniversary of their wedding, too.
This is a surprise!
Anyway, where is your train leaving from?
My train leaves from Platform 3, over there.
How long will you...
Now leaving from Platform 3, train for Vancouver.
That's my train. I have to run. Sorry we didn't get more time to talk.
That's OK. I'll see you when you get back.
Have a good time, and say congratulations to your parents!
