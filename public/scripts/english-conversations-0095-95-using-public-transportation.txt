Did you take the bus to work today?
Yes, I did.
It was on time today.
How about you?
I took the subway.
It was a bit crowded but faster than the bus.
Do you think you'll keep using the subway or try the bus sometime?
I'm not sure.
The subway is faster, but the bus has nice views.
I understand.
Both have good and bad points.
